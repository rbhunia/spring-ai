## Understanding Generative AI

Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence algorithms that can generate new content, ranging from text and images to audio and code. Unlike discriminative models that classify or predict based on input data, generative models learn the underlying patterns and distributions of the training data and then use this knowledge to create new, similar data.

---

### Key Concepts

- **Generative Models**  
  These models learn the probability distribution of the input data and can sample new data points from that distribution. Examples include:
  - Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  - Diffusion Models

- **Training Data**  
  The quality and quantity of training data significantly impact the performance of generative models. A diverse and representative dataset is crucial.

- **Sampling**  
  Once trained, a generative model can create new data by sampling from the learned probability distribution.

- **Latent Space**  
  Many generative models use a latent space to represent the underlying structure of the data in a lower-dimensional space that captures essential features.

---

## Types of Generative Models

### Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

VAEs learn a probabilistic mapping from input data to a latent space and then decode points from the latent space back to the original data space.

**Example:**  
Training a VAE on a dataset of faces allows the model to encode faces into a latent space. By sampling from this space and decoding, the VAE generates new, realistic-looking faces.

---

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

GANs consist of two neural networks:
- **Generator:** Creates new data samples.
- **Discriminator:** Distinguishes between real and generated samples.

The networks are trained adversarially, improving the generator's ability to create realistic data.

**Example:**  
Generating realistic images of cats, where the generator produces cat images and the discriminator evaluates them. Over time, the generator improves in fooling the discriminator.

---

### Diffusion Models

Diffusion models gradually add noise to training data until it becomes pure noise, then learn to reverse this process to generate new data.

**Example:**  
Generating high-resolution images from text descriptions. The model starts with pure noise and iteratively denoises based on a text prompt to create detailed images.

---

## Applications of Generative AI

- **Content Creation**  
  Generate text, images, music, and videos for marketing, entertainment, and education.

  *Example:*  
  Generate marketing copy for a new product based on successful campaigns.

- **Drug Discovery**  
  Design new drug candidates by generating molecules with desired properties.

  *Example:*  
  Generate molecules that bind to a specific protein target, accelerating drug discovery.

- **Code Generation**  
  Generate code snippets or entire programs to automate tasks and improve developer productivity.

  *Example:*  
  Generate code for a simple web application, such as a to-do list.

# Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs are generative AI models trained on massive text datasets. They understand and generate human-like text and excel in various natural language processing tasks.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Transformer Architecture**  
  Uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh word importance, capturing long-range dependencies and context.

- **Pre-training and Fine-tuning**  
  Pre-trained on large text corpora using self-supervised learning, then fine-tuned for specific tasks.

- **Context Window**  
  Refers to the amount of text the LLM can consider when generating or processing text. Larger windows improve coherence.

- **Tokens**  
  Text is broken into tokens (words or subwords). Vocabulary size varies by model.

---

## Popular LLMs

### GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) - by OpenAI

**Example:**  
GPT-3 generates coherent text, writes articles, powers chatbots, and generates code.

---

### BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) - by Google

**Example:**  
Used for sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering with contextual understanding.

---

### LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) - by Google

**Example:**  
Creates chatbots capable of meaningful conversations, understanding user intent, and providing helpful responses.

---

## Applications of LLMs

- **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**  
  Understand and respond to user queries naturally.

  *Example:*  
  Customer service chatbot answers FAQs and resolves issues using an LLM.

- **Text Summarization**  
  Condenses long documents into concise summaries.

  *Example:*  
  Summarize a news article into key bullet points.

- **Language Translation**  
  Translate text between languages for broader accessibility.

  *Example:*  
  Translate a website from English to Spanish using an LLM.

# Ethical Considerations

As Generative AI and LLMs become more powerful, ethical concerns must be addressed.

---

### Bias

Generative AI may inherit biases from training data, leading to unfair outcomes.

**Example:**  
An LLM trained on biased data may associate certain professions with specific genders.

---

### Misinformation

Generative AI can create fake news or deepfakes, spreading false information.

**Example:**  
Generating a fake news article accusing a politician of corruption.

---

### Privacy

Generative AI can infer sensitive personal information from available data.

**Example:**  
Analyzing social media posts to infer political affiliation or personal attributes.

---

## Adding Spring AI Dependencies Manually

You can also add Spring AI dependencies manually via your build file.

### Maven (`pom.xml`)

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-ai-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
        <version>0.8.0</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
        <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
        <optional>true</optional>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

Explanation:
	•	spring-boot-starter-web — For web applications
	•	spring-ai-spring-boot-starter — Core Spring AI dependency (latest version recommended)
	•	lombok — Reduces boilerplate code
	•	spring-boot-starter-test — Test dependencies

⸻

Gradle (build.gradle)

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    implementation 'org.springframework.ai:spring-ai-spring-boot-starter:0.8.0' // Latest version
    compileOnly 'org.projectlombok:lombok'
    annotationProcessor 'org.projectlombok:lombok'
    testImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'
}

Explanation:
	•	Adds Spring Web, Spring AI, Lombok, and testing dependencies

⸻

Configuring Your Application

After setup, configure your app to interact with an LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI).

Application Properties (application.yml)

Steps:
	1.	Create application.yml in src/main/resources
	2.	Add configuration:

spring:
  ai:
    openai:
      api-key: YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY

Note: Replace YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY with your actual key from OpenAI.

Security Tip: Never commit API keys to version control. Use environment variables.

⸻

Using Environment Variables for Security

Set Environment Variable:
	•	On Linux/macOS:

export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY

	•	On Windows:

setx OPENAI_API_KEY "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

Reference in application.yml:

spring:
  ai:
    openai:
      api-key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}



⸻

Configuring Other LLM Providers

For example, with Azure OpenAI:

spring:
  ai:
    azure-openai:
      api-key: YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
      endpoint: YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT

Explanation:
	•	api-key — Your Azure OpenAI API key
	•	endpoint — The deployment endpoint for Azure OpenAI

We will cover other providers in detail in later lessons.

⸻

Verifying Your Setup

Create a simple controller to test interaction with the LLM.

Example: AIController.java

package com.example.springai;

import org.springframework.ai.client.AiClient;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class AIController {

    @Autowired
    private AiClient aiClient;

    @GetMapping("/generate")
    public String generate(@RequestParam("prompt") String prompt) {
        return aiClient.generate(prompt);
    }
}

Explanation:
	•	@RestController — Marks class as a REST controller
	•	@Autowired AiClient — Injects Spring AI client
	•	/generate endpoint sends prompts to the LLM

Test Your Setup:
	•	Run your Spring Boot application
	•	Visit:
http://localhost:8080/generate?prompt=Tell me a joke

If everything is configured correctly, the LLM will generate a joke in the response.

⸻
